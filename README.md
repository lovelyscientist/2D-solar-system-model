Sigma parameters of Rayleigh distribution of eccentricity of main asteroid belt:  

H ≤ 15 	        0.0786 ± 0.0009  
H ≤ 10.8 	    0.0784 ± 0.0041  
H ≤ 8.2 	    0.0728 ± 0.0097  
Inner belt 	    0.0559 ± 0.0023  
Middle belt 	0.0772 ± 0.0025  
Outer belt 	    0.0974 ± 0.0047   

*What's left*:
- shadow of parts of the planets which are not turned to the Sun
- relativity of rotation speed between planets
- ? update of orbits when resizing screen

<small>Successfully tested in <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> and <b>Google Chrome</b></small>

The application is using <b>native</b> ES6 JavaScript, so you need no dependecies to install.

All planet's orbits and speeds are created in terms of real proportions.

Please, find the pictures of planets in /img directory.
